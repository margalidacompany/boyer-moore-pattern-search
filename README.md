# Pattern Search Tool (Boyer-Moore Algorithm)

This is a simple pattern search script written in Python using the Boyer-Moore string matching algorithm. It scans `.txt` files and returns all positions where a given pattern is found. The tool is case-insensitive and supports multiple matches.

## Features
- Uses the Boyer-Moore algorithm for efficient text search
- Supports multiple matches
- Case-insensitive matching
- Detects file encoding using the `chardet` library
- Input validation and basic error handling

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- chardet (`pip install chardet`)

## How to use
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
2. When prompted, enter the path to a .txt file and the pattern you want to search for.
